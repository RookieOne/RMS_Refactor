It started in February 2001 as my attempt to grapple with OS X as the immenent icon environment, and I've certainly learned a lot over the past year! Looking back over what I had done so far, I was feeling the way I always feel when looking at year-old icons of mine: &quot;I could do better than that now!&quot; :-) <br>							<br>							After all the OS X work we ended up doing for clients this past year, I felt I had definitely gained a bit of ground, so I wanted to re-visit the series, apply what I've learned thus far and bring it up to date. <br>							<br>							WOA 3 is much more in line with Apple's Aqua icon guidelines, and hopefully will blend in very smoothly with the rest of the system. I've updated the folders with the look of Apple's standard folder (albeit at a different angle) and I changed the badging angle. Every single element has either been reworked or replaced, so I hope this feels like a &quot;next generation&quot; for the series. <br>							<br>							Amongst the various system-type treats, you'll find a much-requested OS X version of HAL 9000, the new iPod and, of course, the sassy new iMac! <br>							<br>							I hope you enjoy the new icons, and thanks to everyone who has downloaded                the World Of Aqua series and supported the Iconfactory! <br>							<br>							Tack s&aring; mycket! <br>							<br>							Dave <br>							<br>							<br>							Special, heartfelt thanks to Marvilla for all her assistance in converting these icons to XP format, archive quality-checking and general all-around enthusiastic support! Please visit the forums she helps run at:<br>							<br>							<a href="http://www.designtechnika.com" target="_blank">http://www.designtechnika.com</a><br>							<br>							You'll find it's friendly community of folks interested in GUI matters on XP, and also a strong source of support of artists' rights.<br>							<span class="blackbody"><br>							</span>Special thanks go to Ged and Kate for listening to me agonize repeatedly over the past 4 months over about how to handle the treatment of these icons! I think it worked out okay... <br>							<br>							Two musical albums were necessary during assembly: Bj&ouml;rk's &quot;Vespertine&quot; and The Orb's &quot;Cydonia&quot;. (Ennio Morricone's soundtrack to &quot; The Thing&quot; made a few appearances, but it's just too creepy when you're alone in the studio!) <br>							<br>							Thanks especially to Apple for working so hard on OS X (especially the icons!) and for that *sweet* new iMac! <br>							<br>							Viva El President&eacute;! <br>						</td>					</tr>				</table>				<br>				<table width="180" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">					<tr>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="120" height="10" border="0"></td>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10" border="0"></td>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="450" height="10" border="0"></td>					</tr>					<tr>						<td align="right" valign="top"><span class="boldbody">Legality</span></td>						<td></td>						<td>The icons and images represented by these icon are Copyright &copy;2003 The Iconfactory.
